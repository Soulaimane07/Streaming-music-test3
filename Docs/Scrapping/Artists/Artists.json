I efteråret 2024 udgav D1MA det album alle havde ventet, men en helt anden lyd overraskede D1MA-elskerne, den 11. oktober da “7” blev udgivet. “CLEOPATRA” blev en lille appetizer til et nyt lydunivers der for alvor kom til udtryk i boombap-sangen “VÅGN OP” der har indtaget pladserne på TOP-50 op til flere gange. Han er dog stadig maskeret og hans indentitet er endnu ukendt. Der går mange teorier om ham, vi kan sige med stor sikkerhed at han er over 21 år, marrokansk baggrund, kører en Rolls Royce Drophead Coupé, fra Aarhus (Gellerupparken/Trillegården), har haft en svær opvækst og har gået under navnet Grizzy (hans musik findes på SoundCloud)."
